# STL verification

The main goal of the project was Monitoring STL specification in Perception-based Autonomous Systems for self driving cars . At the beginning of the work, the biggest problem was installing a simulator for controlling the trajectory of cars and collect data.

While working, we tried to install and run [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) and [Carla](https://carla.org/) simulator, but this step was interrupted due to computer incompatibility. As a result, we decided to work with [gym-duckietown](https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown). This simulator is very easy to install and use. In addition, there are not many installation requirements.

The modified code for collecting data in simulator is located in [duck-gym](https://github.com/Katerina5649/gym-duckietown)
The dataset for training located in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aJ3H5jKqL7SnzCJ2y1mhq4xVafKIGUZw?usp=sharing)
